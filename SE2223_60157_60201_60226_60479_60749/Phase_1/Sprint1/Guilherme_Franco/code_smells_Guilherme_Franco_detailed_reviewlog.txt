Review done by Lu√≠s Abreu:
    Checked the Code Smell 1: Dead Code, it seems well identified and well justified.
    I would just improve the Refactor proposal, its written in a way a little bit informal.
    
Review done by Tiago Francisco:
	The second identified code smell (message chain) is well explained and very clear. I think that nothing needs to be corrected.
    
Review done by Pedro Gouveia:
    Reviewed the Code Smell : Duplicate Code.
    I think my colleague did an excelent job at finding this code smell. This is a very bad practice and should be fixed.
    The rationale is very well explained but in the refractoring I think Guilherme did an error by mentioning the comboBox as "jumbo box".
