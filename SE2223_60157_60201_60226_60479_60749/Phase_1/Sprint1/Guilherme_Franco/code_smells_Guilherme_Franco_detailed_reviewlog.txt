<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    Checked the Code Smell 1: Dead Code, it seems well identified and well justified.
    I would just improve the Refactor proposal, its written in a way a little bit informal.
Review done by Tiago Francisco:
	The second identified code smell (message chain) is well explained and very clear. I think that nothing needs to be corrected.
=======
    Checked all 3 code smells that you identified, seemed all pretty good.
    I would just improve the Refactor proposal of the Dead Code, its written in a way a little bit informal
