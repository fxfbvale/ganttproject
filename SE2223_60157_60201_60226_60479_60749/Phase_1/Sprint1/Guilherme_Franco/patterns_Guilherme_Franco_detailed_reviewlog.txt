Review done by Lu√≠s Abreu:
   I reviewed the Design Pattern 1: Adapter Pattern, its well identified and well justified!
Review done by Tiago Francisco:
	The second pattern (factory method pattern) is well explained and very clear.
Review done by Pedro Gouveia:
    I reviewed the design pattern: Decorator.
    I think the rationale is almost perfect, but lacks something. It should showcase an example of a wrapping, either by one or multiple classes so we can see an example of the delegation in action.
