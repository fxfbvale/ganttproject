The facade Design Pattern is well justified allowing even a person with no background in IT to understand it.

The second design pattern (observer) is well presented and nothing needs to be corrected.

Related to the third Desgn Pattern I don't really agree with it since it's kinda confused and also the class you chose to show isn't the right one, since the iterator comes from a method from another class, and still that class does more things than just iterate through a data structure in order to hide the implementations to the client.
