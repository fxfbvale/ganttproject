Review done by Lu√≠s Abreu:
    I reviewed the Design Pattern: Facade. Its well identified and well justified, i would just put it in a more formal apresentation way like i said in the code smells review
    
Review done by Pedro Gouveia:
    I review the Design Pattern: Open/Closed. The rationale is valid but it lacks some explanation on why the abstract class is closed and should not be changed.

Related to the Decorator Design Pattern. I agree with the choice, however the explanation is kinda confused, and for someone who is not familiar with GOF design patterns it will be really hard to understand.
