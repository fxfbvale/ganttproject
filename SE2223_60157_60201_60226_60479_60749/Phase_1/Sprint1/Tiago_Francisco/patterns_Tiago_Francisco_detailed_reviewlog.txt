Review done by Lu√≠s Abreu:
    I reviewed the Design Pattern: Facade. Its well identified and well justified, i would just put it in a more formal apresentation way like i said in the code smells review
    
Review done by Pedro Gouveia:
    I review the Design Pattern: Open/Closed. The rationale is valid but it lacks some explanation on why the abstract class is closed and should not be changed.

Related to the third Desgn Pattern I don't really agree with it since it's kinda confused and also the class you chose to show isn't the right one, since the iterator comes from a method from another class, and still that class does more things than just iterate through a data structure in order to hide the implementations to the client.
