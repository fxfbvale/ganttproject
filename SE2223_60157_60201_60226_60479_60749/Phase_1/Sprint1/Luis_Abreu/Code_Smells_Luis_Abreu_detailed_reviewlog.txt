Minor gramatical errors "these class" -> "This class"; "betwenn" -> "Between"; "better store in other class" -> better stored in another class";
"privade" -> "private";
Other than this I agree with the solution provided for the first code Smell (Data Class) and the ratinale is very clear as to why it is considered a data class.

I think the code smells are well identified and the explanation is very clear. The only think to point out is the gramatical error (store to stored) that was not corrected.
