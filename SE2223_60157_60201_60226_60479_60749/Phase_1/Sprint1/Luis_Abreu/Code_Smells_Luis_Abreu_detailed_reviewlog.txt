Minor gramatical errors "these class" -> "This class"; "betwenn" -> "Between"; "better store in other class" -> better stored in another class";
"privade" -> "private";
Other than this I agree with the solution provided for the first code Smell and the ratinale is very clear as to why it is considered a data class.

I think the second code smell is well identified and the explanation is very clear. The only think to point out is the gramatical error (store to stored) in the first code smell that was not corrected.
