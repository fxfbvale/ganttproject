Minor gramatical errors "these class" -> "This class"; "betwenn" -> "Between"; "better store in other class" -> better stored in another class";
"privade" -> "private";
Other than this I agree with the solutions provided and the code smells are well justified, so I agree with them all!

I think the code smells are well identified and the explanation is very clear. The only think to point out is the gramatical error (store to stored) that was not corrected.
