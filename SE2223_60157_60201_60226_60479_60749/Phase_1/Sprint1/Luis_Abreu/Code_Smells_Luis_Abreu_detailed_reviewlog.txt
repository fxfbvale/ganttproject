Minor gramatical errors "these class" -> "This class"; "betwenn" -> "Between"; "better store in other class" -> better stored in another class";
"privade" -> "private";
Other than this I agree with the solution provided for the first code Smell (Data Class) and the ratinale is very clear as to why it is considered a data class.

I think the second code smell is well identified and the explanation is very clear. The only think to point out is the gramatical error (store to stored) in the first code smell that was not corrected.

Related to the third code smell, even though that the number of lines reapeted is small, it is indeed a code smell. The Rationale and the Refactor are both pretty clear and well explained, so I wouldn't change a thing.
