	Reviewed by: Lu√≠s Abreu: Hi Tiago, you forgot to put the name of the metrics you chose and there is a description of something at the beginning of your metrics that is not identified too. I would also develop a little bit more the conclusion you made based on the values of the graphics of this metric.	
	Other than that, the descriptions of the concepts present in this metric are well described, good work!
