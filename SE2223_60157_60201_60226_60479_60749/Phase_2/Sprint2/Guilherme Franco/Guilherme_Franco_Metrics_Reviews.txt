Reviewed by Pedro Gouveia - I think that this review of the Chidamber-Kemerer metrics is very well done and
extensive, when I started reading this piece I had no idea of what these metrics were or for what they were 
used and if they were important for our project but after reading this I was more aware of the code smells I
might encounter and prepared for them.
